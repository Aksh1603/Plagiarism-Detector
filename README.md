# Plagiarism-Detector
NLP project using python
==========================================
My project focuses on developing a Plagiarism Detector using Python's Natural Language Processing capabilities. The goal is to create a tool that can effectively identify instances of text duplication or close paraphrasing within documents. By leveraging NLP techniques, the detector processes and analyzes text data, extracting key features and patterns. It then compares these features against a vast database of existing content to uncover potential plagiarism. This project aims to assist in maintaining academic integrity, ensuring originality in research, and promoting fair practices in content creation.
============================================
To enhance the plagiarism detection capabilities of my project, I experimented with several machine learning models including Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). After rigorous evaluation, the SVM model demonstrated superior accuracy in identifying instances of plagiarism compared to the other algorithms. This finding indicates that SVM's ability to effectively classify text data as plagiarized or original aligns well with the project's objectives.
